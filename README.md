## Team 12 - Milestone 2 Delivery

### [Team 12 Github Repository](https://github.com/ucsd-cse110-fa23/cse-110-project-team-12)

### [Figma Diagram to Use the App](https://www.figma.com/file/0WqcFv8Y6dJTDsmW8fXxyB/PantyPal-UI-Draft?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=rTkiPVYieqxm3biF-1)

#### To start the PantryPal Application:

1. Clone the application repo to your local machine if you have not.
2. Open a terminal instance in the top-level directory of the codebase *(where the repo was downloaded)*. Your terminal should show something along the lines of `.../cse-110-project-team-12` as the current working directory.
3. Run the following command in the terminal:
    - For **Mac** users: `./gradlew run -Pmain=edu.ucsd.cse110.server.Server`
    - For **Windows** users: `./gradlew run -P main=edu.ucsd.cse110.server.Server`

    This initializes the server for the application.
4. Open a new terminal instance *(with the same working directory as the previous one)* and run the following command: `./gradlew run`

    This starts the application.
