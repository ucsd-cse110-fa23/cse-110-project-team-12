## Team 12 - Milestone 2 Delivery

### [Team 12 Github Repository](https://github.com/ucsd-cse110-fa23/cse-110-project-team-12)

#### To start the PantryPal Application:

1. Clone the application repo to your local machine if you have not.
2. Open a terminal instance in the top-level directory of the codebase *(where the repo was downloaded)*. Your terminal should show something along the lines of `.../cse-110-project-team-12` as the current working directory.
3. Run the following command in the terminal: **`./gradlew run -P main=edu.ucsd.cse110.server.Server`** This initializes the server for the application.
4. Open a new terminal instance *(with the same working directory as the previous one)* and run the following command: **`./gradlew run`** This starts the application.
