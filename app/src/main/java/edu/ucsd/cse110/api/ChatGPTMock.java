					"Cook the rice according to package instructions and set it aside.\n" + //
					"Warm the black beans and corn in a separate pot or microwave, then set them aside.\n" + //
					"Dice the tomatoes, shred the lettuce, and grate the cheese.\n" + //
					"Assemble the Taco Bowls:\n" + //
					"Start with a layer of cooked rice in each avocado half.\n" + //
